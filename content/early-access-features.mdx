</Warning>

EdgeBlog is actively developing two advanced capabilities for Enterprise customers. Both features are currently being tested with a small group of early partners before wider release.

## Digital PR & Backlink Outreach

Automate your digital PR workflow to earn high-quality backlinks at scale.

**What it does:**

- **Outreach identification** — Discovers relevant journalists, bloggers, and publications in your industry
- **Personalized pitching** — AI-crafted outreach emails tailored to each recipient's beat and recent coverage
- **Link opportunity detection** — Finds broken links, resource pages, and guest post opportunities where your content is a natural fit
- **Campaign tracking** — Monitors outreach status, response rates, and acquired backlinks

Digital PR works alongside your existing article pipeline. As EdgeBlog generates and publishes content, the PR module identifies promotion opportunities for each piece.

## Deep Research & Data Journalism

Go beyond standard AI content with original research and data-driven articles.

**What it does:**

- **Multi-source research** — Aggregates data from public datasets, industry reports, and authoritative sources
- **Original analysis** — Produces unique insights, trend analyses, and data visualizations that can't be found elsewhere
- **Citation-backed claims** — Every statistic and finding links back to its primary source
- **Differentiated content** — Creates genuinely novel articles that stand out from typical AI-generated content

Deep Research articles take longer to produce but generate significantly more organic backlinks and social shares due to their original data and insights.
