## Organization Name

Your organization name is displayed at the top of the Team page. Click the edit icon next to it to change it. This name is visible to all members and appears throughout the dashboard.

## Members

The members list shows everyone in your organization. Each entry displays the member's:

- **Name** and **avatar**
- **Email address**
- **Role** — Admin or Member

All members have full access to every site and all content within the organization.

## Inviting Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Team page">
    Navigate to **Team** from the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter their email">
    Type the email address of the person you want to invite into the input field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the invitation">
    Click **Invite**. The invitee will receive an email invitation with a link to join your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="They sign in">
    When the invitee signs in using the link, they automatically join your organization as a **Member**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Removing Members

To remove a member from your organization, click **Remove** next to their name. A confirmation dialog will appear asking you to confirm the action. Once confirmed, the removed member loses access to all organization sites immediately.

<Note>
  You cannot remove yourself from the organization.
</Note>

## Pending Invitations

If there are outstanding invitations that haven't been accepted yet, they appear in a separate **Pending Invitations** section below the members list. You can revoke any pending invitation before it's accepted by clicking **Revoke**.

<Note>
  All team members have the same level of access — there are no per-site permissions. Any member can view and manage all sites in the organization.
