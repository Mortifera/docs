<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does article generation take?">
    Most articles are generated in **5-10 minutes**. You can monitor progress in real time from your Pipeline page. The AI researches your industry, writes the article, generates a header image, and refines the content based on quality scoring, all automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit generated articles?">
    You can manage an article's metadata from the detail page, including the URL slug, author, and publish status. Direct editing of article body content is not currently available. If an article needs significant changes, you can delete it and generate a new one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the blog match my website's style?">
    When you add your site, EdgeBlog's AI analyzes your website's design (layout, colors, typography, navigation) and generates matching blog templates. Your blog looks like a natural extension of your existing site, with consistent branding throughout.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't like the template?">
    You can customize your templates using the [Template Editor](/customization/templates). Use **AI Chat mode** to describe changes in natural language, or switch to **Raw Editor** for direct HTML editing. You can also re-clone from your Site Settings to start fresh from your current website design.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own domain?">
    Yes. EdgeBlog is designed to serve your blog at your own domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com/blog`). Set up [CDN routing](/setup/cdn-routing) to proxy requests to EdgeBlog, or use the [Blog Widget](/setup/blog-widget) for a simpler embed approach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does billing work?">
    EdgeBlog offers three tiers: **Starter**, **Growth**, and **Enterprise**. Each tier includes different article limits, site quotas, and features. [View plan details](/reference/plans-and-limits). For custom needs, contact **support@edgeblog.ai**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete articles?">
    Yes. Deleting an article is a **soft delete**. The article is hidden but can be restored within 30 days from the **Deleted** tab on your Pipeline page. [Learn more about article statuses](/reference/article-statuses).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add team members?">
    Go to the [Team Management](/account/team-management) page, enter their email address, and click **Invite**. They'll receive an invitation email and automatically join your organization when they sign in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the content SEO optimized?">
    Yes. Every article includes structured data, optimized meta tags, semantic HTML, and keyword optimization. Growth and Enterprise plans also include **GEO** (Generative Engine Optimization) for AI-powered search engines. [Learn more about SEO](/analytics/seo-optimization).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if generation fails?">
    Occasionally, article generation may encounter an error. Failed articles are marked with a **Failed** status and appear in the **Failed** tab on your Pipeline page. You can delete the failed article and try generating a new one. If failures persist, contact **support@edgeblog.ai** for assistance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I signed up but see a 'Needs Invitation' page. What do I do?">
    EdgeBlog is currently invite-only. Contact your organization admin or reach out to **support@edgeblog.ai** to request access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit article content directly?">
    Not currently. You can manage article metadata (slug, author, status, publish date) from the article detail page. If an article needs significant content changes, delete it and generate a new one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My article generation failed. What should I do?">
    Check the **Failed** tab on your Pipeline page. You can delete the failed article and generate a new one. If failures keep happening, contact **support@edgeblog.ai** for help.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does my blog need CDN routing to work?">
    CDN routing or the blog widget is needed for visitors to access your blog on your domain. Without either, your content is only accessible at edgeblog.ai URLs. See [CDN Routing](/setup/cdn-routing) or [Blog Widget](/setup/blog-widget) for setup instructions.
