title: Adding a Site
description: Connect your website and create your blog in minutes
---

The onboarding wizard walks you through connecting your website and setting up your blog. The entire process takes about two minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your website URL">
    From your dashboard, click **"+ Add Site"** and paste your website's URL. EdgeBlog validates the URL and begins analyzing your site.

    Use your homepage or main landing page for the best results. This gives the AI the most complete picture of your brand's design.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic site cloning">
    EdgeBlog's AI analyzes your website's design and creates a matching blog template. This takes about 60 seconds. You'll see progress as it:

    - **Records and analyzes** your site's visual design (layout, colors, fonts, and navigation)
    - **Generates a blog listing page** styled to match your site
    - **Creates an article template** that matches your brand for individual posts

    The result is a blog that looks like it was custom-built as part of your website.

    <Tip>If cloning fails, you'll see an error message with a retry option. Common causes include password-protected sites or pages that block automated access.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your blog path">
    Choose where your blog will live on your domain. Common choices include:

    | Path | URL Example |
    |------|-------------|
    | `/blog` | `yourdomain.com/blog/article-title` |
    | `/resources` | `yourdomain.com/resources/article-title` |
    | `/insights` | `yourdomain.com/insights/article-title` |

    This determines your blog's URL structure. Pick something that fits your site's existing navigation.

    You can change your blog path later from your site's Settings page. Note that changing the path requires updating your CDN routing rules to match.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your content strategy">
    Set your initial content preferences. You can adjust all of these later from your site's Strategy page.

    - **Target audience:** Who are you writing for? Describe your ideal reader (e.g., "SaaS founders looking to grow organic traffic")
    - **Writing tone:** Professional, conversational, technical, or casual. Choose what fits your brand.
    - **Articles per month:** Set your publishing cadence. EdgeBlog can auto-generate articles on schedule, or you can generate them manually

    All strategy settings can be updated anytime from the [Content Strategy](/content/content-strategy) page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and create">
    Confirm your settings and create your site. You'll be taken to your new site's dashboard, where you can:

    - Preview your blog template
    - Generate your first article
    - Set up routing to serve your blog on your domain
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>You can add multiple sites depending on your plan. Each site gets its own template, strategy, and content pipeline.</Tip>

<Note>After creating your site, you'll want to [connect your blog](/setup/cdn-routing) to your domain and [generate your first article](/content/generating-articles).</Note>
