title: Connecting Your Blog
description: Serve your EdgeBlog content on your own domain
---

EdgeBlog hosts and renders your blog content, but your visitors access it through your own domain. To them, your blog at `yourdomain.com/blog` looks and feels like any other page on your site, because it is.

## How it works

You add routing rules to your hosting provider so that requests to your blog path (e.g., `/blog`) are proxied to EdgeBlog's servers. Your visitors never leave your domain. They see your URL in the browser, your SSL certificate, and your branding. EdgeBlog handles the content delivery behind the scenes.

## Setting up routing

You need two routing rules:

1. **Exact path:** `yourdomain.com/blog` proxies to EdgeBlog (your blog listing page)
2. **Wildcard path:** `yourdomain.com/blog/*` proxies to EdgeBlog (individual articles)

Choose your hosting provider below for specific instructions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloudflare Workers">
    Create a Cloudflare Worker that intercepts requests to your blog path and forwards them to EdgeBlog.

    ```js
    export default {
      async fetch(request) {
        const url = new URL(request.url);
        if (url.pathname.startsWith('/blog')) {
          const target = new URL(request.url);
          target.hostname = 'edgeblog.ai';
          target.pathname = '/b/your-site-slug' + url.pathname.replace(/^\/blog/, '');
          return fetch(target, { headers: request.headers });
        }
        return fetch(request);
      }
    };
    ```

    Deploy this Worker and add a route pattern matching `yourdomain.com/blog*`.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Vercel (vercel.json)">
    Add rewrites to your `vercel.json` configuration file. This is the **recommended** approach for Vercel — it preserves response headers for the best verification experience.

    ```json
    {
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/blog",
          "destination": "https://edgeblog.ai/b/your-site-slug"
        },
        {
          "source": "/blog/:path*",
          "destination": "https://edgeblog.ai/b/your-site-slug/:path*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Commit and deploy. The rewrites take effect immediately.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Next.js (next.config)">
    If you prefer to keep routing in your Next.js config (or don't have a `vercel.json`), add rewrites to `next.config.ts`:

    ```ts
    const nextConfig = {
      async rewrites() {
        return [
          {
            source: '/blog',
            destination: 'https://edgeblog.ai/b/your-site-slug',
          },
          {
            source: '/blog/:path*',
            destination: 'https://edgeblog.ai/b/your-site-slug/:path*',
          },
        ];
      },
    };

    export default nextConfig;
    ```

    <Warning>Next.js rewrites may strip custom response headers from the proxied response. This won't affect your blog content, but EdgeBlog's verification will use content inspection instead of header detection. For full header passthrough, use `vercel.json` rewrites instead.</Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Netlify">
    Add these rules to your `_redirects` file (or `netlify.toml`):

    ```
    /blog    https://edgeblog.ai/b/your-site-slug    200
    /blog/*  https://edgeblog.ai/b/your-site-slug/:splat  200
    ```

    The `200` status code tells Netlify to proxy the request (rewrite) rather than redirect, so your visitors stay on your domain.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Nginx">
    Add these location blocks to your Nginx server configuration:

    ```nginx
    location /blog {
        proxy_pass https://edgeblog.ai/b/your-site-slug;
        proxy_set_header Host edgeblog.ai;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

    location /blog/ {
        proxy_pass https://edgeblog.ai/b/your-site-slug/;
        proxy_set_header Host edgeblog.ai;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
    ```

    Reload Nginx after saving: `sudo nginx -s reload`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>Replace `your-site-slug` with your actual site slug, and `/blog` with your configured blog path. You can find these values on your site's **Setup** page in the dashboard.</Note>

## Testing your setup

After configuring your routing rules, try visiting `yourdomain.com/blog` in your browser. If you see your EdgeBlog content, the proxy is working. If you see a 404 or your site's own 404 page, double-check your routing configuration.

## Verifying your connection

After setting up routing, verify that everything is working:

1. Go to your site's **Setup** page in the EdgeBlog dashboard
2. Click **"Verify Connection"**
3. EdgeBlog sends a test request through your domain to confirm the proxy is configured correctly

EdgeBlog uses two detection methods to verify your connection:

1. **Header detection** — EdgeBlog blog pages return a special `x-edgeblog` response header. If the header arrives through your proxy, verification passes immediately. This is the strongest signal.
2. **Content detection** — If the header is missing (some proxies strip custom headers), EdgeBlog checks the response body for a signature meta tag. If found, verification still passes. You'll see a hint suggesting `vercel.json` rewrites for full header passthrough if you're on Vercel.

You'll see one of three statuses:

| Status | Indicator | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Verified** | Green | Your blog is connected and serving content. You're all set. |
| **Pending** | Amber | Not yet verified. Run verification after setting up your routing rules. |
| **Error** | Red | Verification failed. Double-check your routing configuration and try again. |

<Warning>If verification fails, the most common issues are: incorrect site slug in the proxy destination, mismatched blog path between EdgeBlog and your routing rules, missing wildcard rule for sub-paths, missing Host header forwarding (especially with Nginx), SSL/TLS configuration issues, or DNS propagation delay. Wait a few minutes and try again.</Warning>
