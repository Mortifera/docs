description: "Understanding the article lifecycle"
---

Every article in EdgeBlog moves through a defined lifecycle. Understanding these statuses helps you manage your content pipeline effectively.

## Status Flow

```
Idea → Generating → Draft → Approved → Published
                      ↓                     ↓
                    Failed               Deleted
```

## Status Definitions

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Idea** | Queued for generation. The article is waiting to be picked up by the AI pipeline. |
| **Generating** | The AI is actively working on this article. Sub-phases include researching, writing, reviewing, refining, and imaging. Takes about 5-10 minutes. |
| **Draft** | Generation is complete. The article is ready for your review. |
| **Approved** | You've reviewed and approved the article. It's ready to be published. |
| **Published** | The article is live on your blog and visible to visitors. |
| **Failed** | An error occurred during generation. You can delete the article and try again. |
| **Deleted** | The article has been soft-deleted. It can be restored within 30 days from the Deleted tab on your Pipeline page. |

## Auto-Publish

If auto-publish is enabled in your [Content Strategy](/content/content-strategy), articles that score **7/10 or higher** during quality review are automatically published upon completion. These articles skip the Draft and Approved stages entirely, going straight from Generating to Published.

<Info>
  Auto-publish is available on Growth and Enterprise plans. You can enable it from your site's Content Strategy settings.
