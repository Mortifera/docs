## Site Settings

Each site has its own settings page accessible from the site's sidebar navigation under **Settings**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Display Name">
    The name shown in your dashboard for this site. This is for your reference only and does not appear on your public blog.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blog Path">
    The URL path where your blog is served (e.g., `/blog`, `/resources`). Changing this requires updating your CDN routing rules to match.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Site Slug">
    The unique identifier used in your blog's URL. This is set when you create the site and is used for routing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Re-Cloning Your Website

If your website's design has changed and you want your blog templates to match the updated look, use the **Re-Clone** button on your site's Settings page. This regenerates your blog listing and article templates based on your current website design.

<Tip>
  Re-cloning does not affect your existing published articles. Only the templates (header, footer, navigation, and styling) are updated.
</Tip>

## Deleting a Site

In the **Danger Zone** section at the bottom of your site's Settings page, click **Delete Site**. You'll need to type the site's hostname to confirm the deletion.

<Warning>
  Deleting a site takes your blog offline immediately. Published articles will no longer be accessible to visitors.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Deleted sites can be restored from the main dashboard. Look for the "Deleted Sites" section at the bottom of your sites list.
