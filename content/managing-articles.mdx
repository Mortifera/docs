description: Review, approve, publish, and organize your content
---

Your site's **Pipeline** page is the command center for all your content. From here you can track articles through every stage, review drafts, publish content, and manage your entire content library.

## Pipeline view

The Pipeline page shows all articles organized by status. Use the filter tabs to quickly find what you're looking for:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **All** | Every article across all statuses |
| **Ideas** | Queued articles waiting to be generated |
| **Generating** | Articles currently being written by AI |
| **Drafts** | Completed articles ready for your review |
| **Approved** | Articles you've approved, ready to publish |
| **Published** | Live articles visible on your blog |
| **Failed** | Articles that encountered an error during generation |
| **Deleted** | Soft-deleted articles (restorable for 30 days) |

<Info>You can manage an article's metadata (status, slug, author, publish date) from the detail page. Direct editing of article body content is not currently available. If an article needs significant changes, you can delete it and generate a new one.</Info>

## Article actions

From an article's detail page, you can take the following actions depending on its current status:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Approve">
    Mark a draft as reviewed and ready to publish. This moves the article from the **Drafts** tab to the **Approved** tab, signaling to your team that the content has been vetted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Publish">
    Make the article live on your blog immediately. Once published, the article is accessible to visitors and indexed by search engines.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unpublish">
    Take a published article offline. The article returns to draft status, the published URL returns a 404, and the published date is cleared. If you re-publish later, a new publish date is assigned.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delete">
    Soft-delete the article. Deleted articles are moved to the **Deleted** tab and can be restored for up to 30 days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restore">
    Recover a deleted article to its previous status. Available from the **Deleted** tab within the 30-day retention window.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Article detail page

Click any article to view its detail page. This gives you a complete picture of the article and its metadata:

- **Live preview:** See exactly how the article will appear on your blog, rendered with your site's template and styling
- **Status card:** Current status with available actions (approve, publish, unpublish, delete)
- **Author card:** Assign or change the article's byline author
- **URL & Slug card:** View and customize the article's URL slug
- **Details card:** Generation phase, review score, and iteration count
- **Timestamps card:** Created, updated, and published dates

## Editing slugs

You can customize an article's URL slug from the detail page. Click the slug field to edit it. Slugs are automatically sanitized to lowercase with hyphens. Spaces and special characters are converted for you.

<Warning>Changing the slug of a published article will break existing links. The old URL will return a 404, and no automatic redirect is created. If the article has already been indexed by search engines, consider keeping the original slug.</Warning>

## Scheduling

You can set a scheduled publish date using the date picker on the article detail page. When the scheduled time arrives, the article is automatically published — no manual action needed.

<Note>Articles must be in **draft** or **approved** status to be auto-published at their scheduled time. Articles in other statuses (e.g., idea, generating) will not be published automatically.</Note>

When you enable a [publishing cadence](/content/content-strategy), EdgeBlog automatically generates articles and schedules them to publish on weekdays during business hours (Pacific time), spread throughout the week for a natural posting rhythm.

<Tip>Enable **Auto-Publish** in your [content strategy](/content/content-strategy) settings to go fully hands-off. Articles scoring 7/10 or higher on quality review will be published at their scheduled time without manual approval.</Tip>
