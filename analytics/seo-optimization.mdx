description: How EdgeBlog optimizes your content for search engines
---

Every article generated by EdgeBlog includes built-in SEO optimization. You don't need to configure anything. It's all handled automatically as part of the content generation process.

## Automatic SEO

Each article is published with the following optimizations out of the box:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Structured data">
    JSON-LD BlogPosting schema markup is added to every article, enabling rich search results with author information, publish dates, and article metadata.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Meta tags">
    Optimized title tags, meta descriptions, and OpenGraph tags are generated for each article. These control how your content appears in search results and when shared on social media.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Semantic HTML">
    Articles use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) and semantic HTML elements, making content easy for search engine crawlers to parse and understand.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sitemap">
    Your blog's sitemap is automatically generated and kept up to date as you publish new articles. With [SEO Discovery](/analytics/seo-discovery), the sitemap also includes your existing website pages with smart priority values. Search engines use this to discover and index your content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Internal linking">
    The AI automatically links between your articles where relevant, building a strong internal link structure that helps search engines understand the relationships between your content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keyword optimization">
    Articles are optimized for your focus keywords defined in your [Content Strategy](/content/content-strategy). The AI naturally weaves keywords into headings, body text, and meta information without keyword stuffing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

Beyond traditional SEO, EdgeBlog also optimizes your content for AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and others. As more people use AI-powered search tools to find information, having content that these tools can easily understand, cite, and recommend becomes a competitive advantage. GEO ensures your content is discoverable and citable in AI-generated answers.

GEO optimization includes:

- **Key facts and summaries:** Structured information that AI search engines can easily extract and cite in their responses
- **Citation-friendly formatting:** Content structured so AI can reference and attribute your articles as sources
- **Entity recognition:** Clear identification of people, products, and concepts for knowledge graph inclusion
- **Related queries:** Content that anticipates and answers follow-up questions users might ask

<Note>GEO optimization is available on Growth plans and above. [View plan details](/reference/plans-and-limits).</Note>

## Tips for better SEO performance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keep your keyword strategy current">
    Review and update your [keyword strategy](/content/content-strategy) as your business evolves. New products, services, or market shifts should be reflected in your content direction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optimize your article slugs">
    Review article slugs for readability. Short, descriptive URLs perform better in search results than long or generic ones. You can edit slugs from the [article detail page](/content/managing-articles).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish consistently">
    Search engines favor sites with regular new content. Use your [content strategy cadence](/content/content-strategy) to maintain a steady publishing rhythm.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Be patient">
    SEO results typically take 2 to 4 weeks to materialize. Newly published articles need time to be crawled, indexed, and ranked. Resist the urge to make changes too quickly. Let your content build momentum.
