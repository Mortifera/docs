title: How EdgeBlog Works
description: Understand the AI-powered pipeline behind your content
---

Every article EdgeBlog creates goes through a four-stage pipeline designed to produce content that ranks in both traditional search engines and AI-powered search. Here's what happens behind the scenes when you generate an article.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Website Cloning">
    When you add your website, our AI analyzes your site's design — layout, colors, typography, navigation — and creates a pixel-perfect blog template that matches your brand. Your blog will look like a natural extension of your existing site.

    There's nothing to configure. Just paste your URL and EdgeBlog handles the rest.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Research">
    Multiple AI research agents work in parallel to build a deep understanding of your industry and audience:

    - **Content & brand analysis** — Studies your existing content to understand your voice, messaging, and positioning
    - **SEO opportunity research** — Identifies high-value keywords and analyzes competitor strategies
    - **Audience intelligence** — Discovers what your target audience is actively searching for
    - **Industry scanning** — Monitors trends, news, and emerging topics in your space
    - **AI search optimization (GEO)** — Evaluates how AI-powered search engines surface and cite content, so your articles are optimized for both traditional and AI search

    This parallel research approach means your articles are grounded in real data, not generic templates.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Writing & Optimization">
    Using the research insights, the AI writes a full-length article optimized for discoverability:

    - **SEO-optimized structure** with proper heading hierarchy, meta descriptions, and keyword placement
    - **Internal linking** between your articles to build topical authority
    - **Custom header image** generated to match your content
    - **Structured data** for rich search results (featured snippets, knowledge panels)
    - **AI search optimization** with citation-ready facts, entity markup, and summary-friendly formatting
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review & Refinement">
    Every article goes through an automated quality review before it reaches you:

    - Scored on a **10-point scale** across quality, accuracy, and SEO effectiveness
    - **Iteratively improved** based on detailed feedback — the AI rewrites and refines until the article meets quality standards
    - Only delivered to your dashboard once it passes review

    You always have the final say. Review the article, make edits if you'd like, and publish when you're ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>Articles typically generate in 5-10 minutes. You can monitor progress in real time from your dashboard.</Info>
