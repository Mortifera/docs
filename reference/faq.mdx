<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does article generation take?">
    Most articles are generated in **5-10 minutes**. You can monitor progress in real time from your Pipeline page. The AI researches your industry, writes the article, generates a header image, and refines the content based on quality scoring -- all automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit generated articles?">
    Yes. Once an article reaches **Draft** status, you can view and manage it from the article detail page. You can edit the URL slug, change the author, and control when it's published.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the blog match my website's style?">
    When you add your site, EdgeBlog's AI analyzes your website's design -- layout, colors, typography, navigation -- and generates matching blog templates. Your blog looks like a natural extension of your existing site, with consistent branding throughout.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't like the template?">
    You can customize your templates using the [Template Editor](/customization/templates). Use **AI Chat mode** to describe changes in natural language, or switch to **Raw Editor** for direct HTML editing. You can also re-clone from your Site Settings to start fresh from your current website design.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own domain?">
    Yes. EdgeBlog is designed to serve your blog at your own domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com/blog`). Set up [CDN routing](/setup/cdn-routing) to proxy requests to EdgeBlog, or use the [Blog Widget](/setup/blog-widget) for a simpler embed approach.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does billing work?">
    EdgeBlog offers three tiers: **Starter**, **Growth**, and **Enterprise**. Each tier includes different article limits, site quotas, and features. [View plan details](/reference/plans-and-limits). For custom needs, contact **support@edgeblog.ai**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete articles?">
    Yes. Deleting an article is a **soft delete** -- the article is hidden but can be restored within 30 days from the **Deleted** tab on your Pipeline page. [Learn more about article statuses](/reference/article-statuses).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add team members?">
    Go to the [Team Management](/account/team-management) page, enter their email address, and click **Invite**. They'll receive an invitation email and automatically join your organization when they sign in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the content SEO optimized?">
    Yes. Every article includes structured data, optimized meta tags, semantic HTML, and keyword optimization. Growth and Enterprise plans also include **GEO** (Generative Engine Optimization) for AI-powered search engines. [Learn more about SEO](/analytics/seo-optimization).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if generation fails?">
    Occasionally, article generation may encounter an error. Failed articles are marked with a **Failed** status. You can delete the failed article and try generating a new one. If failures persist, contact **support@edgeblog.ai** for assistance.
