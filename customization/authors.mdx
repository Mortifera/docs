description: Manage author profiles for your blog content
---

Author profiles give your articles a human voice. When enabled, each article displays a byline with the author's name, title, and bio --- building trust with readers and reinforcing your team's expertise.

## Enabling author attribution

Toggle author attribution on or off from the top of your **Authors** page (or in your [Content Strategy](/content/content-strategy) settings).

- **Enabled** --- Articles display author bylines with name, title, and avatar
- **Disabled** --- Articles appear without any author attribution

## Adding authors

Click **"+ Add Author"** and fill in the profile details:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | First and last name |
| **Job Title** | No | Their role or position (e.g., "Head of Marketing") |
| **Topic Expertise** | No | Comma-separated areas of expertise, displayed as badges |
| **Bio** | No | A short author biography |
| **Active** | --- | Only active authors can be assigned to new articles |
| **Default** | --- | The default author is automatically assigned to new articles |

<Tip>Set a default author so new articles are automatically attributed. You can always change the author later from the article detail page.</Tip>

## AI-generated bios

Click **"Generate Bio"** when adding or editing an author. The AI writes a professional biography based on the author's name, title, and expertise areas. You can edit the generated bio before saving.

## Importing from your organization

Click **"Import from Organization"** to create author profiles from your team members. This pulls names from your organization's member list and creates profiles for each person. Duplicates are automatically skipped, so you can safely import multiple times as your team grows.

## Assigning authors to articles

From any article's detail page, use the **Author** card in the sidebar to select an author from the dropdown. Only active authors appear in the selection list.

<Note>When you change an article's author after publishing, the original author is still credited in the article's structured data for SEO continuity.</Note>
