Your site's **Pipeline** page is the command center for all your content. From here you can track articles through every stage, review drafts, publish content, and manage your entire content library.

## Pipeline view

The Pipeline page shows all articles organized by status. Use the filter tabs to quickly find what you're looking for:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **All** | Every article across all statuses |
| **Ideas** | Queued articles waiting to be generated |
| **Generating** | Articles currently being written by AI |
| **Drafts** | Completed articles ready for your review |
| **Approved** | Articles you've approved, ready to publish |
| **Published** | Live articles visible on your blog |
| **Failed** | Articles that encountered an error during generation |
| **Deleted** | Soft-deleted articles (restorable for 30 days) |

## Article actions

From an article's detail page, you can take the following actions depending on its current status:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Approve">
    Mark a draft as reviewed and ready to publish. This moves the article from the **Drafts** tab to the **Approved** tab, signaling to your team that the content has been vetted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Publish">
    Make the article live on your blog immediately. Once published, the article is accessible to visitors and indexed by search engines.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unpublish">
    Take a published article offline. The article returns to draft status and is no longer visible on your blog.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Delete">
    Soft-delete the article. Deleted articles are moved to the **Deleted** tab and can be restored for up to 30 days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restore">
    Recover a deleted article to its previous status. Available from the **Deleted** tab within the 30-day retention window.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Article detail page

Click any article to view its detail page. This gives you a complete picture of the article and its metadata:

- **Live preview** — See exactly how the article will appear on your blog, rendered with your site's template and styling
- **Status card** — Current status with available actions (approve, publish, unpublish, delete)
- **Author card** — Assign or change the article's byline author
- **URL & Slug card** — View and customize the article's URL slug
- **Details card** — Generation phase, review score, and iteration count
- **Timestamps card** — Created, updated, and published dates

## Editing slugs

You can customize an article's URL slug from the detail page. Click the slug field to edit it. Slugs are automatically sanitized to lowercase with hyphens — spaces and special characters are converted for you.

<Warning>Changing the slug of a published article will break existing links. The old URL will return a 404 — no automatic redirect is created. If the article has already been indexed by search engines, consider keeping the original slug.</Warning>

## Scheduling

You can set a scheduled publish date using the date picker on the article detail page. This serves as a planning marker for your content calendar, helping you and your team coordinate when articles should go live.

<Tip>Use scheduled dates alongside your [content strategy](/content/content-strategy) cadence to plan a consistent publishing rhythm across weeks and months.</Tip>
