EdgeBlog's AI pipeline handles the entire article creation process, from research to final draft. Here's how to generate an article and what to expect.

## How to generate an article

Navigate to your site's **Pipeline** page and click **"Generate Article"**. A confirmation dialog will appear. If you're within your monthly article quota, generation begins immediately.

## What happens during generation

Once you kick off generation, your article moves through six stages automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Researching">
    Multiple AI agents research your industry, competitors, audience needs, and SEO opportunities in parallel. This ensures every article is grounded in real data about your market and what your audience is searching for.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Writing">
    The AI writes a full-length article using the research insights, optimized for both traditional search engines and AI-powered search. Your [content strategy](/content/content-strategy) settings (audience, tone, and keywords) directly shape the output.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reviewing">
    The article is scored on a **10-point scale** evaluating quality, accuracy, and SEO effectiveness. Detailed feedback is generated identifying specific areas for improvement.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refining">
    If the review score falls below the quality threshold, the article is iteratively improved based on the feedback. The AI rewrites weak sections, strengthens SEO elements, and tightens the overall structure. This review-and-refine cycle repeats until the article meets quality standards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Imaging">
    A custom header image is generated to match the article's topic and your brand aesthetic. This image is automatically included in the final article.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalizing">
    The article is formatted with proper heading structure, internal links, structured data, and meta information, then delivered to your dashboard as a draft ready for your review.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>Generation typically takes 5-10 minutes. You'll see real-time progress updates on your Pipeline page.</Info>

## If generation fails

Occasionally, article generation may encounter an error. When this happens:

- The article's status moves to **Failed** and appears in the **Failed** tab on your Pipeline page
- You can delete the failed article and generate a new one
- If failures persist, contact **support@edgeblog.ai** for assistance

<Tip>You can see the review score and iteration count for any article on its detail page in the **Details** card. Articles scoring **7/10 or higher** pass quality review.</Tip>

## Article quotas

Your plan determines how many articles you can generate per month. The quota resets on the first of each month. You can see your current usage displayed on the Pipeline page next to the generate button.

If you've reached your monthly limit, the generate button will be disabled until your quota resets or you upgrade your plan.

## Automatic generation

If you've configured a publishing cadence in your [Content Strategy](/content/content-strategy), articles can be generated automatically based on your schedule. EdgeBlog will create articles at the pace you've set, no manual intervention required.

Automatic generation respects your monthly quota. If you've used all your articles for the month, scheduled generation will pause until your quota resets.

<Tip>Combine automatic generation with auto-publish (available on Growth plans and above) for a fully hands-off content pipeline. See [Content Strategy](/content/content-strategy) for details.</Tip>
