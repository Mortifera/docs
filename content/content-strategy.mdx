title: Content Strategy
description: Configure your blog's tone, audience, and publishing cadence
---

Your content strategy tells the AI what to write about and how. These settings directly influence every article generated for your site, from the topics researched to the tone of voice used in the final draft.

To configure your strategy, navigate to your site's **Strategy** page from the sidebar.

## Target Audience

Describe who you're writing for. The more specific you are, the better the AI can tailor content to resonate with your readers. Think about your ideal customer's role, industry, company stage, and what problems they're trying to solve.

  <Tab title="Good example">
    "B2B SaaS marketing teams at Series A-C companies looking to scale their content operations without hiring a full editorial team."
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Too vague">
    "Marketers" or "business owners"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

A detailed audience description helps the AI choose relevant topics, use appropriate terminology, and write at the right level of depth for your readers.

## Writing Tone

Choose the voice that best fits your brand. This setting shapes the style and personality of every article:

| Tone | Best for |
|------|----------|
| **Professional** | Enterprise brands, financial services, B2B. Formal, authoritative, and data-driven. |
| **Conversational** | SaaS, consumer brands, startups. Friendly, approachable, uses "you" language. |
| **Technical** | Developer tools, engineering blogs. Detailed, precise, assumes domain expertise. |
| **Casual** | Creative agencies, lifestyle brands. Relaxed, informal, personality-forward. |

## Focus Keywords

Enter a comma-separated list of keywords and topics you want to rank for. These guide the AI's research and SEO optimization, ensuring your articles target the search terms that matter most to your business.

**Example:** `content marketing, SEO automation, AI blog tools, programmatic SEO`

<Tip>Start with 5-10 high-priority keywords. You can always add more as you learn what's driving traffic. Mix broad terms with specific long-tail phrases for the best coverage.</Tip>

## Publishing Cadence

Set how many articles you want per month using the slider. This controls the pace of automatic generation if you have it enabled.

The maximum cadence is determined by your plan tier. If you need a higher volume, you can upgrade your plan at any time.

## Auto-Publish

When enabled, articles that score **7/10 or higher** during quality review are automatically published to your blog without manual approval. Articles that score below the threshold are still delivered as drafts for your review.

This is ideal for teams that want a hands-off content pipeline while maintaining a quality floor.

<Note>Auto-publish is available on Growth plans and above. [View plan details](/reference/plans-and-limits).</Note>

## How strategy influences generation

Your strategy settings are fed into every stage of the article generation pipeline:

- **Audience** shapes the writing style, depth, and topic selection
- **Tone** controls the voice, formality, and personality of the content
- **Keywords** guide SEO research and optimization priorities
- **Cadence** paces content production to match your publishing goals

Every article is uniquely generated based on these inputs combined with real-time research about your industry and competitors. No two articles are the same, even with identical settings.

<Tip>Review and update your strategy periodically. As your business evolves, keeping your audience description and keywords current helps the AI produce more relevant content.</Tip>
