title: Adding a Site
description: Connect your website and create your blog in minutes
---

The onboarding wizard walks you through connecting your website and setting up your blog. The entire process takes about two minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your website URL">
    From your dashboard, click **"+ Add Site"** and paste your website's URL. EdgeBlog validates the URL and begins analyzing your site.

    Use your homepage or main landing page for the best results — this gives the AI the most complete picture of your brand's design.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic site cloning">
    EdgeBlog's AI analyzes your website's design and creates a matching blog template. This takes about 60 seconds. You'll see progress as it:

    - **Records and analyzes** your site's visual design — layout, colors, fonts, and navigation
    - **Generates a blog listing page** styled to match your site
    - **Creates an article template** that matches your brand for individual posts

    The result is a blog that looks like it was custom-built as part of your website.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your blog path">
    Choose where your blog will live on your domain. Common choices include:

    | Path | URL Example |
    |------|-------------|
    | `/blog` | `yourdomain.com/blog/article-title` |
    | `/resources` | `yourdomain.com/resources/article-title` |
    | `/insights` | `yourdomain.com/insights/article-title` |

    This determines your blog's URL structure. Pick something that fits your site's existing navigation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your content strategy">
    Set your initial content preferences. You can adjust all of these later from your site's Strategy page.

    - **Target audience** — Who are you writing for? Describe your ideal reader (e.g., "SaaS founders looking to grow organic traffic")
    - **Writing tone** — Professional, conversational, technical, or casual — choose what fits your brand
    - **Articles per month** — Set your publishing cadence. EdgeBlog can auto-generate articles on schedule, or you can generate them manually
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and create">
    Confirm your settings and create your site. You'll be taken to your new site's dashboard, where you can:

    - Preview your blog template
    - Generate your first article
    - Set up routing to serve your blog on your domain
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>You can add multiple sites depending on your plan. Each site gets its own template, strategy, and content pipeline.</Tip>

<Note>After creating your site, you'll want to [connect your blog](/setup/cdn-routing) to your domain and [generate your first article](/content/generating-articles).</Note>
