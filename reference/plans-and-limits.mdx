## Feature Breakdown

### Articles Per Month

The number of articles your organization can generate each calendar month. This quota is shared across all sites in your organization. Each article generation counts toward your monthly quota, regardless of the article's final status (draft, published, or failed). Unused articles do not roll over to the next month.

### Sites

The maximum number of sites you can add to your organization. Each site represents a separate blog served on a distinct domain.

### Authors Per Site

The number of author profiles you can create per site. Authors are displayed as bylines on published articles.

### Max Publishing Cadence

The maximum number of articles that can be scheduled for publishing per month per site through your [Content Strategy](/content/content-strategy) settings.

### Auto-Publish

When enabled in your Content Strategy, articles that pass quality review (scoring 7/10 or higher) are published automatically. Available on Growth and Enterprise plans. [Learn more about article statuses](/reference/article-statuses).

### GEO Optimization

Generative Engine Optimization ensures your articles are structured to appear in AI-powered search results (like AI Overviews and conversational search). Available on Growth and Enterprise plans. [Learn more about SEO and GEO](/analytics/seo-optimization).

### Custom Templates

Enterprise plans include the ability to use fully custom HTML templates for your blog listing and article pages, beyond the AI-generated templates.
