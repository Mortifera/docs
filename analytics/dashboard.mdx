description: Track your blog's performance
---

Your analytics dashboard shows how your blog content is performing. Navigate to your site's **Analytics** page to view metrics, trends, and breakdowns.

## Metrics

Four key metrics are displayed as cards at the top of the dashboard, each with period-over-period comparison:

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Impressions** | Total number of times your blog pages were loaded |
| **Visits** | Unique visits across your blog |
| **Clicks** | Outbound link clicks from your articles to your main site |
| **CTR** | Click-through rate: the percentage of impressions that result in a click |

Each metric shows the current period value and a percentage change compared to the previous period, indicated by an up or down arrow.

## Time ranges

Select your reporting window from the options at the top of the dashboard:

- **7 days:** Recent activity snapshot
- **30 days:** Monthly performance view
- **90 days:** Quarterly trends
- **All time:** Complete history since your blog launched

## Traffic over time

An area chart displays three series (views, visits, and clicks) over your selected time range. Use this to spot growth trends, identify traffic spikes from successful articles, and understand your blog's trajectory.

## Article performance

A ranked table of your top-performing articles by views. This tells you which topics are resonating with your audience. Click any article to jump directly to its detail page.

## Click destinations

Shows where your readers are clicking, specifically which pages on your main site are receiving traffic from your blog. This is your most direct measure of blog ROI, connecting content performance to business outcomes.

<Info>Analytics tracking is automatic. A lightweight tracking script is injected into your blog pages. No setup required on your part. EdgeBlog tracks page loads, unique visits, and outbound link clicks. No personally identifiable information is collected. Tracking data is associated with your site, not individual visitors.</Info>

<Tip>Use the Click Destinations table to identify which articles are driving traffic to high-value pages like pricing or signup. Generate more content on similar topics to amplify what's working.</Tip>
