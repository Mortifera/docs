description: Customize how your blog looks

When you add a site, EdgeBlog's AI generates HTML templates that match your website's existing design. These templates control the look and feel of every page on your blog without requiring any manual design work.

## What are templates?

Each site has two templates:

- **Blog Listing** --- The main blog page that displays your article cards in a grid or list layout
- **Article Template** --- The page layout for individual articles, including the header, navigation, content area, and footer

Together, these templates ensure your blog feels like a natural extension of your website rather than a separate product.

## Template editor

Navigate to your site's **Templates** page to open the editor. You'll see a split-pane layout with a live preview on the left and editing tools on the right.

### Left panel --- Live preview

The preview shows how your blog will appear to visitors. Toggle between two views:

- **Live** --- Rendered with sample articles so you can see the full experience
- **Raw** --- The underlying HTML source for inspection

### Right panel --- Editor

The editor supports two modes for making changes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AI Chat">
    Describe changes in natural language, and the AI updates the template for you. The preview refreshes automatically so you can see the result instantly.

    Example prompts:
    - "Make the header background darker"
    - "Change the font to a serif typeface"
    - "Add more spacing between article cards"
    - "Move the navigation links to the left"
    - "Make the article title larger on mobile"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Raw Editor">
    Edit the template HTML directly for precise control. The preview updates as you type, giving you immediate feedback on every change.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>Start with AI Chat mode for quick adjustments, and switch to Raw Editor for fine-grained control when needed.</Tip>

## Switching templates

Use the tabs at the top of the editor to switch between editing the **Blog Listing** template and the **Article Template**. Changes to each template are tracked independently.

## Saving changes

When you're happy with your edits, click **"Save"**. Changes take effect immediately across all your articles and blog pages --- there's no separate publish step.

<Note>Template changes affect all articles on your site. Preview your changes carefully before saving.</Note>

## Re-cloning

If you've redesigned your website and want a fresh set of templates, you can re-clone from your **Site Settings** page. This regenerates all templates from scratch based on your current website design.

Re-cloning replaces your existing templates entirely, including any manual edits you've made. If you've customized your templates and want to keep those changes, save a copy of the HTML before re-cloning.
